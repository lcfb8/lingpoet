        <h2>Can you use them in a poem?</h2>
        <h3>We're not interested in words with a similar etymological root or loan words. We're looking for the weird words, the ones that are the same purely through coincidence.</h3>
        <p>To start, let's look at some examples of words across languages that are spelled the same but mean completely different things. Note that as linguists, we are interested in all words, even those that may be considered slang, informal, or vulgar.</p>

       <p>Some classics from the world of cinema. In Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian, "fart" means "speed" and "slut" means "end." <small>Source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/1p83sy6/the_swedish_title_of_a_movie_named_speed/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephenlaconte/finding-dory-swedish-translation-omg">Buzzfeed</a></small></p>--->

        <p>The hit Norwegian TV show "SKAM" ends with a title screen reading "Alt Er Love" — "Everything is Love" — using the English word "Love." However, it's also a play on words with the Norwegian phrase "Alt Er Lov" — everything is allowed/permitted. Additionally, "lover" in Norwegian is a verb meaning "to promise."</p>
        <p>What could a love poem look like, incorporating some of these words? Promises, lovers, gifts, poison... what hidden meanings can you find?</p>
