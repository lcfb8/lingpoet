***Play with words. Get lost in languages. Accidentally learn something***<br>

A project created by lcfb8 and aullanisa for DPI-691M: Programming and Data for Policymakers at Harvard Kennedy School, January 2026.

## 🎯 Project Goal (aka the Secret Master Plan)
This project exists to lure **language nerds, poets, and curious internet wanderers** into playing with words - purely for fun…  
*and then surprise them with learning.*

Through playful word coincidences across languages, users can:
- Explore languages they’ve never seen before  
- Test their wildly questionable linguistic intuition  
- Discover how the **same word** can mean *very different things* in different places

**Bonus side quest**  
Poets and writers can use this chaos to spark **unexpected metaphors, catchy phrases, and poetic mischief**.

## 🧠 What Does This Project Actually Do?

Under the hood, this project:
- Uses a cleaned lexical database sourced from **kaikki.org**
- Filters words that share *coincidences* across languages
- Turns those coincidences into two playful tools:

### Word Studio
A language exploration playground where users can:
- Browse word coincidences  
- Jump between languages  
- Let curiosity drive the journey

### Go Wander
A randomized word quiz that challenges users to:
- Guess meanings  
- Make connections  
- Get confidently wrong *(the best way to learn)*

## 🤔 Why Does This Exist?

Because discovering that:
> A word sounds familiar but means something completely unhinged in another language  
…is **hilarious**, humbling, and oddly inspiring.

We wanted to:
- Share that joy  
- Let others play with it  
- Turn linguistic accidents into **creativity fuel**

Learning doesn’t always need textbooks.  
Sometimes it just needs a weird word.
