                This is a space shaped by attention to <em>language</em>.<br>
                To how words are chosen, placed, and allowed to <em>mean</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                Here, language is not rushed.<br>
                It is examined, enjoyed, and <em>occasionally left open</em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                The website is built as a shared practice - part linguistic, part poetic - by two people who care about how words work and how they feel.

                Lydia is a language enthusiast and a Mid-Career Master in Public Administration student at the Harvard Kennedy School.<br>
                Her professional background is in higher education and arts administration.<br>
                Before coming to Harvard, she worked in the Office of the Arts at MIT, where language often had to move between institutions, disciplines, and people who did not always speak the same way.<br>
                She pays attention to structure, nuance, and the small decisions that change meaning.<br>
                She believes clarity can be generous, and that precision does not have to be cold.<br>
                Lydia approaches language as something to be understood - and <em>respected</em>.

                <p>
                Elsa is a poetry enthusiast and a Master in Public Policy student at the Harvard Kennedy School.<br>
                Her professional background is in statistics.<br>
                Before coming to Harvard, she worked at a statistical agency, where numbers were expected to be exact, even when what they described was not.<br>
                She is drawn to rhythm, imagery, and the emotional weight carried by a line.<br>
                She listens for how language moves, where it pauses, and what it leaves behind.<br>
                Elsa approaches language as something to be felt - <em>and returned to</em>.

                Lydia and Elsa are co-authors of this website.<br>
                They share a love for words, an eye for detail, and a belief that language shapes how we pay attention.

                One tends to ask <em>how language works</em>.<br>
                The other wonders <em>what it does to us</em>.
